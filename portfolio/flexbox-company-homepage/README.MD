Company Homepage

I built this one-page comepany site completely with flexbox. No Javascript, no flexgrid - just flexboxes. I am not a fan - I prefer flex-grid. But this is what the assignment required.

This page is also built mobile-first responsive. It's the first time I've built a page this way, and it makes a lot of sense to start with the smallest screen and from there expand to accomodate wider and taller resolutions. 

Most of the time went into the design - picking images, color schemes, stuff like that. I have less affinity with design and it's hard to make something from scratch. 
I enjoyed building it, though. If anything, this project taught me I'm more of a developer than a designer.
